    Notes:
        - BaseSettings, from pydantic, validates the data so that when we create an instance of Settings,
        environment and testing will have types of str and bool, respectively.
        - BaseSettings automatically reads from env variables
        - In other words, environment: str = "dev" is equivalent to environment: str = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "dev").
        - AnyUrl is a pydantic URL validator
